# Employment-Prediction
The project is to predict the employability of college students based on their study records. 
The task is accomplished by using various classifier models from scikit-learn library. 
The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the relationships between the features and the target variable. 
After finding the most compatible model, GridSearchCV is used to optimize the hyperparameters. 
The final model can be used to predict the employability of new students based on their study records. 

<br>This project can be useful for anyone interested in using machine learning for prediction tasks, especially in the field of education.
